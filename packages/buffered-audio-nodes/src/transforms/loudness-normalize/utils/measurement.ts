 * Measure integrated loudness (BS.1770-4 / EBU R128) over a whole-file
 * `ChunkBuffer`. Streams the buffer in `CHUNK_FRAMES`-frame chunks
 * through an {@link IntegratedLufsAccumulator}, holding only one chunk
 * plus the bounded gating state in memory at any time. Constant memory
 * in source duration.
 *
 * Channel weighting defaults to 1.0 per channel (correct for mono and
 * stereo). BS.1770-4 surround weighting (Ls/Rs at 1.41) is not yet
 * supported here; if surround support becomes a requirement, surface a
 * `channelWeights` parameter and forward it through.
 *
 * Returns `-Infinity` for silent / sub-block-length signals — callers
 * must treat this as a no-op gain (the linear-shift target is undefined
 * when the input has no measurable loudness).
