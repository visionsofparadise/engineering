/**
 * Transfer curve for the loudnessTarget node — three-segment, anchor-
 * based shape with direct dB gain values at each anchor and a brick-
 * wall extension above the limit anchor.
 *
 * Per design-loudness-target §"Curve shape" (post `plan-loudness-target-
 * limit-axis` rewrite).
 *
 * Three anchors as `(level, gainDb)` pairs:
 *   (floorDb,  0)            optional pass-through anchor; absent when
 *                            anchors.floorDb === null.
 *   (pivotDb,  B)            body anchor; B iterated for target LUFS.
 *   (limitDb,  peakGainDb)   limit anchor; closed-form
 *                            peakGainDb = effectiveTargetTp - limitDb.
 *                            `limitDb` defaults to `sourcePeakDb` (no
 *                            limiting) when peak control is disengaged,
 *                            and is iterated downward toward `pivotDb`
 *                            as the LRA-axis lever otherwise.
 *
 * The curve has up to three segments plus a brick-wall extension:
 *   - lower segment (only when floorDb !== null): linear ramp from
 *     gainDb = 0 at floorDb to gainDb = B at pivotDb.
 *   - mid (upper-body) segment: linear ramp from gainDb = B at pivotDb
 *     to gainDb = peakGainDb at limitDb.
 *   - brick-wall above limitDb: gainDb decreases 1 dB per 1 dB of
 *     additional absXDb so the apparent output level stays clamped at
 *     `effectiveTargetTp = limitDb + peakGainDb`.
 *
 * The brick-wall derivation:
 *   effectiveTargetTp = limitDb + peakGainDb       (closed-form rearranged)
 *   apparent output   = absXDb + gainDb
 *   set to ceiling    = effectiveTargetTp
 *   ⇒ gainDb          = effectiveTargetTp - absXDb
 *                     = limitDb + peakGainDb - absXDb
 *
 * Sonically: brick-wall in the gain envelope is sample-by-sample; in
 * the time domain it is smoothed by the bidirectional IIR (see
 * envelope.ts and §"Smoothing — peak-respecting two-stage envelope").
 *
 * Direct anchor gains, not normalised. Differs deliberately from
 * loudnessShaper / loudnessExpander's `1 + B · shape(|x|)` formulation,
 * which assumes a single boost factor multiplied by a 0–1 shape. With
 * two independent anchors (body B and limit peakGainDb), normalisation
 * forces awkward arithmetic; direct interpolation between
 * (level, gainDb) pairs is shorter and segment-local.
