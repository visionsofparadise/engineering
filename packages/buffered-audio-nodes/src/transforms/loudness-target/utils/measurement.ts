 * Combined source measurement for the loudnessTarget node.

 * integrated LUFS, LRA, and 4× true peak in a single chunked walk
 * through the source. The expander's `measurement.ts` measures only
 * integrated LUFS (no peak anchor); this module extends that pattern
 * with a parallel {@link TruePeakAccumulator} and uses
 * {@link LoudnessAccumulator} (rather than `IntegratedLufsAccumulator`)
 * to get LRA in the same pass.
 *
 * The pass also carries a per-channel {@link TruePeakUpsampler} array, a
 * {@link SlidingWindowMaxStream} (instantiated at base rate with
 * `halfWidth = windowSamplesFromMs(smoothingMs, baseRate)`), and an
 * {@link AmplitudeHistogramAccumulator} over the POOLED base-rate
 * detection signal — i.e. `raw 4×: levels_4×[k] = max_c |upChannels[c][k]|`
 * collapsed to base rate by max-of-4 and then run through the
 * `SlidingWindowMaxStream`. This is the SAME signal the curve evaluates
 * per attempt in the apply path's `buildBaseRateDetectionCache` →
 * curve-eval chain. Matching axes so the percentile-derived
 * `limitAutoDb` lands on the same distribution the curve's brick-wall
 * branch actually sees (per the 2026-05-13 histogram-axis fix; prior
 * raw-4× axis under-estimated typical curve-input levels because the
 * pool collapses ~`(2·halfWidth+1)·4` raw samples into a single
 * curve-input sample by max).
 *
 * Walk granularity matches the rest of the loudness sub-system
 * (`44_100` frames per chunk). All accumulators consume the same
 * per-chunk channel slices in lockstep — single source pass, constant
 * memory beyond the bounded accumulator state.
