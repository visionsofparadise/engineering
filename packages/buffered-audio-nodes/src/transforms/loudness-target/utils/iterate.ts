/**
 * Joint two-axis iteration for the loudnessTarget node — every attempt
 * updates BOTH `B` (body gain) and `peakGainDb` (upper-segment anchor)
 * based on the previous attempt's (lufsErr, peakErr). Replaces the
 * earlier sequential Phase A → Phase B structure (see the 2026-05-13
 * decision in `design-loudness-target.md`).
 *
 * Per design-transforms §"Memory discipline": the source itself is
 * streamed via `buffer.read(CHUNK_FRAMES)` loop until short chunk; never
 * materialised as a full-source-sized Float32Array at this level.
 *
 * Two perceptual targets — `targetLufs` and `targetTp` — converge
 * jointly on two curve parameters, `(B, peakGainDb)`. The limit
 * anchor `limitDb` is set ONCE at iteration entry from the
 * auto-derivation table:
 *   - `limitDbOverride` set         → use it (clamped)
 *   - else `limitAutoDb` finite     → use it (clamped) — this is the
 *     percentile-derived threshold from `measureSource`'s top-down walk
 *     over the 4×-rate detection-envelope histogram (per
 *     `plan-loudness-target-percentile-limit`)
 *   - else                          → `sourcePeakDb` (no limiting; the
 *     brick-wall branch is dormant for every sample)
 *
 * `limitDb` is constant across attempts: it is a statistical property
 * of the source (or a fixed user value), not something the iteration
 * negotiates. LRA falls out of the resulting geometry as a consequence
 * — there is no LRA target axis (see `plan-loudness-target-percentile-
 * limit` §"Decisions").
 *
 * ## Joint per-attempt update
 *
 * Both axes move every attempt. The two per-axis update rules:
 *
 * - **`B` via 1D secant on LUFS error**. On attempt 1 with one history
 *   point, the first probe applies the RMS-shift correction `B - lufsErr`
 *   to seed the secant. On attempt ≥ 2, classical 1D secant on the most
 *   recent two attempts (slope `dLUFS/dB`, minimum magnitude
 *   `MIN_SECANT_SLOPE` to avoid degenerate steps). Step-magnitude
 *   damping is **asymmetric** (preserved from the sequential design's
 *   2026-05-11 decision): same-sign consecutive errors → no cap, trust
 *   the secant; sign-flipped consecutive errors → cap at 1× previous
 *   step magnitude (no-revert-past-known-bad rule). `B` clamped to
 *   `[-30, 30]` dB.
 *
 * - **`peakGainDb` via proportional feedback on signed peakErr**
 *   (`peakErr = outputTruePeakDb - effectiveTargetTp`). On any attempt
 *   where `|peakErr| > peakTolerance`, the next attempt's
 *   `currentPeakGainDb` is shifted by `-peakErr * PEAK_DAMPING`:
 *     - `peakErr > 0` (output above target) → decrease `peakGainDb`
 *       (pull peaks down).
 *     - `peakErr < 0` (output below target) → increase `peakGainDb`
 *       (push peaks up). Symmetric: undershoot is corrected the same
 *       way overshoot is. Replaces the earlier one-sided `peakOvershoot
 *       = max(0, peakErr)` formulation, which left TP undershoots
 *       uncorrected (the iterator reported convergence even when output
 *       sat well below the ceiling).
 *   Bounded below by `PEAK_GAIN_DB_FLOOR`; no upper bound because
 *   `peakGainDb` can validly exceed `B` (expansive upper segment) when
 *   the source's peak headroom permits.
 *
 * ## Why joint (vs the prior sequential design)
 *
 * The sequential Phase A → Phase B design assumed stationary curve
 * geometry within each phase: A moved `peakGainDb` with `B` held; B
 * moved `B` with `peakGainDb` frozen at A's terminal value. Empirical
 * findings from a full-render QA (Pretrained ep 060 Pierce chain)
 * showed Phase B's large body-gain moves coupling to TP through the
 * smoothed envelope below `limitDb` — final output landed +2.25 dBTP
 * over target despite Phase A having converged inside `peakTolerance`.
 * Sequential assumed the coupling was weak; for EXPANSIVE_UPPER_SEGMENT
 * curves (`peakGainDb > B`) it isn't.
 *
 * Joint iteration breaks the stationarity assumption deliberately: each
 * attempt's measurement reflects the joint effect of both axes, and the
 * next attempt's per-axis updates use that joint signal. This is
 * coordinate descent in 2D — converges when the coupling is mild and
 * lets both axes correct in lockstep when it isn't.
 *
 * **Slope-contamination hazard** (the bug sequential existed to fix):
 * the B-secant's slope estimate spans attempts where `peakGainDb` is
 * also moving, so the slope reflects motion on a non-stationary
 * function. Mitigation: the asymmetric damping (sign-flip → 1× cap)
 * prevents the contaminated slope from runaway overshoot — same-sign
 * descent self-validates the secant's local prediction, and sign-flips
 * engage the cap. Empirically this holds on EXPANSIVE_UPPER_SEGMENT
 * curves where coupling is strongest; documented as the trade-off for
 * single-loop convergence on coupled axes.
 *
 * ## Symmetric peak error (formerly one-sided overshoot)
 *
 * `peakErr = outputTruePeakDb - effectiveTargetTp` is **signed**. The
 * convergence gate is `|peakErr| < peakTolerance` (two-sided). The
 * best-attempt score is `sqrt(lufsErr² + peakErr²)` (both axes
 * two-sided). The earlier code computed `peakOvershoot = max(0, peakErr)`
 * which left undershoots invisible to the convergence gate and to the
 * score — an attempt with output sitting 0.5 dBTP below target reported
 * `converged = true` and scored 0 on the peak axis even though peaks
 * landed well outside Matt's editorial tolerance. The signed
 * formulation makes both directions equally penalising.
 *
 * ## Convergence gates (checked in order each attempt)
 *
 *   1. **Two-decimal-precision gate (always active)**: fires when
 *      `round(|lufsErr| × 100) === 0` AND
 *      `skipPeak || round(|peakErr| × 100) === 0`. This is the
 *      "perfect to the user-visible precision" exit — the
 *      iteration-end log line reports `outputLufs` / `outputTruePeakDb`
 *      to two decimal places, so once both axes round to their
 *      targets at that precision additional attempts cannot improve
 *      the reported result. Unconditional — does NOT consult
 *      `tolerance` / `peakTolerance`. Now uses `|peakErr|` instead of
 *      one-sided `peakOvershoot`.
 *   2. **Tolerance-based gate**: fires when `|lufsErr| < tolerance`
 *      AND `skipPeak || |peakErr| < peakTolerance`. Skipped silently
 *      when `tolerance` / `peakTolerance` are undefined (per the
 *      "undefined ⇒ run to budget" contract on the BAG schema).
 *
 * ## Pipeline per attempt
 *
 *   1. Build anchors `{ floorDb, pivotDb, limitDb, B, peakGainDb }`.
 *   2. **Walk A** — curve + forward IIR over the pre-built BASE-RATE
 *      detection envelope cache (post 2026-05-13 base-rate-downstream
 *      rewrite). Writes into `forwardEnvelopeBuffer` at base rate.
 *   3. **Walk B sub-pass B1** — backward IIR over `forwardEnvelopeBuffer`
 *      at base rate into `activeRef` (the per-attempt smoothed envelope
 *      destination, also at base rate).
 *   4. **Walk B sub-pass B2** — apply (multiply source × `activeRef` at
 *      base rate) + measure (LUFS / LRA / true peak — the
 *      `TruePeakAccumulator` handles its own internal 4× upsample for
 *      TP detection) over the source ChunkBuffer.
 *   5. Record `(B, peakGainDb, lufsErr, peakErr, outputLra)`. On
 *      best-attempt update, swap `activeRef` / `winningRef` (pointer-
 *      level, no envelope copy). Otherwise clear `activeRef` for the
 *      next attempt.
 *
 * ## Best-attempt fallback
 *
 * Track the attempt with the smallest `sqrt(lufsErr² + peakErr²)` (both
 * signed; equal weighting between axes). On `maxAttempts` exhaustion or
 * joint infeasibility, return that attempt's smoothed envelope plus its
 * `(B, peakGainDb)` and `converged = false`. The buffer-swap mechanic
 * guarantees the held `winningRef` envelope matches the reported
 * `(bestB, bestPeakGainDb)` — both are updated together inside the same
 * `score < bestScore` branch. This fixes the discrepancy in the prior
 * sequential design where the `bestB` could be set from a different
 * attempt than the one whose envelope was held.
 *
 * No axis weighting in the score: equal cost on `lufsErr` and `peakErr`
 * is the point of joint iteration — single-measurement priority is what
 * sequential Phase A → Phase B was, and it produced the failure mode
 * that motivated the rewrite. On infeasible joint targets the fallback
 * returns the locally-balanced attempt; the convergence gates remain
 * `|lufsErr| < tolerance AND |peakErr| < peakTolerance` (both required).
 *
 * `bestLimitDb` on `IterateResult` is a constant value (same across
 * all attempts) — kept for diagnostic continuity with the iteration-end
 * log line.

 *      `halfWidth` on the leading edge and flushes the trailing
 *      `halfWidth` samples on `isFinal === true`).

 *      shorter than the input chunk in the leading-edge regime, and
 *      longer than the input chunk on the final chunk when the trailing
 *      edge flushes).
 *   4. Append the IIR output to `forwardEnvelopeBuffer` and the min-

 *   a 0.5× cap geometrically bounded total reach).
 *
 * - **Sign-flipped consecutive errors** (overshot target — we now
