/**
 * Cache-build helper for the loudnessTarget iteration loop.
 *
 * Per `plan-loudness-target-base-rate-downstream.md` (the 2026-05-13
 * base-rate-downstream rewrite, which partially supersedes the
 * 2026-05-12 stream-caching design): the only signal that
 * STRUCTURALLY needs 4× rate is the detection envelope, because the
 * max-pool across upsampled samples is what captures inter-sample
 * peaks for the curve. Everything downstream of detection (Walk A's
 * forward IIR, the backward pass, Walk B's apply, `_unbuffer`'s
 * apply) operates on a smoothed gain envelope that is bandlimited far
 * below base-rate Nyquist — so storing/applying at base rate loses
 * nothing, and the `source × envelope` multiply produces no
 * meaningful high-frequency content (no AA filter needed). User has
 * empirically validated this.
 *
 * Concretely, this builder now produces exactly one cache:
 *
 *   - A base-rate, single-channel detection envelope `ChunkBuffer`,
 *     `frames === source.frames`. Built by streaming the source
 *     ChunkBuffer at base rate, upsampling each chunk inline to 4×
 *     for the max-pool, collapsing to base rate by max-of-4, and
 *     pushing the base-rate chunk through `SlidingWindowMaxStream`
 *     instantiated at base rate (with a halved `halfWidth` so the
 *     window covers the same milliseconds as the prior 4× slider).
 *
 * The upsampled-source cache that the 2026-05-12 design produced
 * (sized `frames × OVERSAMPLE_FACTOR × channelCount` — ~3.3 GB on a
 * 71-min stereo source) is GONE — no source cache exists at all.
 * Iteration walks (Phase 2 of the plan) read the source `ChunkBuffer`
 * directly at base rate.
 *
 * The 4× upsampled chunks produced inline here are NOT retained: each
 * is consumed by the max-pool fill loop and dropped before the next
 * chunk is read. Memory ceiling for upsampled data is one chunk
 * (`CHUNK_FRAMES × OVERSAMPLE_FACTOR × channelCount × 4 bytes` —
 * ~5.6 MB for a stereo 44.1 kHz chunk), not source length.
 *
 * The returned `ChunkBuffer` lazily spills to disk above the 10 MB
 * scratch threshold so the in-memory footprint stays bounded
 * regardless of source length. The caller owns the lifecycle — call
 * `close()` when it goes out of use.
 *
 * The `SlidingWindowMaxStream` runs ONCE during cache build with
 * state continuity across chunks. Its leading-edge defer of
 * `halfWidth` samples is owned by this builder so callers see a
 * fully-populated detection buffer of exact length `frames` (base
 * rate). The final input chunk is signalled with `isFinal === true`
 * so the trailing-edge outputs flush.
 *
 * Memory discipline (per design-transforms §"Memory discipline"):
 * never materialise a source-sized `Float32Array`. The persistent
 * per-chunk scratch is sized at the maximum upsampled chunk length
 * (for the 4× max-pool inner loop) and the maximum base-rate chunk
 * length (for the post-collapse slider input), not the source length.
 *
 * Phase 2 contract: iterate.ts will be rewritten to import this
 * function under its new name `buildBaseRateDetectionCache`, consume
 * the single returned `ChunkBuffer` as `detectionEnvelope` (base
 * rate, `frames === source.frames`), drop all references to
 * `upsampledSource`, and read the source `ChunkBuffer` directly at
 * base rate inside Walk B and `_unbuffer`. Until Phase 2 lands, the
 * iterate.ts call site will fail to typecheck because the old export
 * name is gone and the old two-cache return shape is gone — this is
 * expected per the plan's Phase 1 verification wording.
