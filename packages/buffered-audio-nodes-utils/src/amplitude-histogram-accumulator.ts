/**
 * Streaming amplitude histogram accumulator.
 *
 * Same output shape as the one-shot {@link amplitudeHistogram} utility in
 * `histogram.ts`, but consumes the signal in chunks and never buffers the
 * full input. Used by `loudnessStats` (and other targets) to derive the
 * amplitude distribution while running, in constant memory.
 *
 * The bucket range `[0, bucketMax)` is established lazily as samples
 * arrive: when a chunk's local max exceeds the running `bucketMax`, the
 * accumulator rebuckets existing counts into the wider range (mapping
 * each old bucket's center into the new range) and continues. Rebucketing
 * is rare in practice — `bucketMax` stabilises within the first few
 * chunks for typical content. With 1024 buckets the rebucketing
 * resolution is finer than any practical percentile precision
 * requirement.
 *
 * Sample-count invariant: `sum(buckets)` is conserved exactly across
 * rebucketing — a center-mapped sample lands in exactly one new bucket.
