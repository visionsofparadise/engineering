/**
 * One-pole IIR smoothing helper. Single-source-of-truth for the
 * smoothing math used by the loudnessShaper offline node and any
 * future utility that needs the same shape.
 *
 * For a one-pole low-pass with time constant tau and sample period T:
 *   alpha = 1 - exp(-T / tau)
 *   y[n]  = alpha * x[n] + (1 - alpha) * y[n-1]
 *
 * `applyBidirectional` cascades two passes (forward then backward) for
 * zero-phase response. To make the user-facing `smoothingMs` parameter
 * map to the magnitude response of a single causal pass at tau, each
 * pass uses tau_pass = sqrt(2) * tau. This keeps the parameter's
 * meaning consistent between offline (bidirectional) and any future
 * real-time variant (single causal pass).
 *
 * `applyCausal` is the single-pass form. State is carried by the
 * caller via `{ value: number }` so chunked use can be continuous.
 *
 * `applyForwardPass` is the chunked-streaming forward HALF of the
 * bidirectional cascade — same loop body as `applyCausal`, but using
 * `alphaBidirectional` (the sqrt(2)-compensated alpha) so the result,
 * when followed by `applyBackwardPassInPlace`, matches
 * `applyBidirectional` byte-for-byte. State is caller-managed
 * `{ value: number }` for chunk-boundary continuity.
 *
 * `applyBackwardPassInPlace` runs the backward HALF of the bidirectional
 * cascade IN PLACE on a buffer (overwrites it). Whole-array, not
 * chunked — backward IIR cannot stream forward through chunks because
 * it must walk end-to-start. The "in place" qualifier is the savings:
 * the caller hands in the post-forward buffer; this method overwrites
 * it with the final smoothed result without allocating a separate
 * output array. Init from `buffer[buffer.length - 1]`, matching
 * `applyBidirectional`'s second pass.
 *
 * At `smoothingMs <= 0` all methods are identity (forward / causal
 * return a fresh copy of the input; in-place backward is a no-op).
